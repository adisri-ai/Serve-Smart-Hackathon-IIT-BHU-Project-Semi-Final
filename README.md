# Project Introduction  
The project was an implementation of image classification of military or civil infrastructure based on machine learning models among 12 different image classes  
# Final project Directory  
1. **Report_AI_Squad_NITW.pdf** : PDF file containing in-depth project description.
2. **Code.py** : Source code of our ML Model
3. **outputs.zip** : Final outputs obtained based on given data.
# Result Metrics  
We obtained an accuracy of around 54% which significantly large among 12 class-classification given that the probability of a random guess being correct is just around 8.33%!  
We beat the probability of random guess being correct by almost 6.5 times.
# Final Result  
Our team advanced to the **National Finals** of the hackathon among **1400+ registered participants**
